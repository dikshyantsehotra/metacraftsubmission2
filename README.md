This Solidity smart contract, SimpleContract, is designed for the Ethereum blockchain and requires Solidity version 0.8.9 or higher. It defines four private state variables: number (an unsigned integer), text (a string), addr (an Ethereum address), and flag (a boolean). To interact with these variables, the contract provides public setter and getter functions for each.

The setter functions (setNumber, setText, setAddress, and setFlag) take an argument of the corresponding type, update the private state variable with this value, and return the new value. These functions allow users to modify the state variables.

The getter functions (getNumber, getText, getAddress, and getFlag) are read-only (marked as view) and return the current value of the respective state variable. This allows users to retrieve the values without modifying the contract's state.

By keeping the state variables private and providing public setter and getter methods, the contract ensures that the internal state is encapsulated, exposing only the intended interface for interaction. The use of the MIT license, as indicated by the SPDX license identifier at the top, specifies that this code is open-source and can be freely used, modified, and distributed.
